# What is Tuckr

Tuckr is a dotfile manager as well as a symlink farm.
It aims to reduce the amount of work necessary to get up and running on a new machine.
It aims to be a simple tool that extends stow by taking inspiration from other tools such as yadm, chezmoi, odin and go.

Since simplicity is one of the main goals of this project, the tool tries as much as possible to avoid any sort of configuration.
The dotfiles repository is the configuration.
This makes it easy to learn how to use and setup everything by just understanding a couple of concepts that are reused everywhere.
The consistency of the repo also allows to make assumptions annd be able to validate that everything is being setup correctly.
